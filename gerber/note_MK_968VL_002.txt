Notice for make of   MK_968VL_002 card.

1.) most important: your risk  and  no right by full support.


Component-list:
U33			let U33 empty,  DDC Interface doesn't run right (and failed hardware cursor)
L3 & U11 	place L3 OR  U11, you must not place both at same time. I recommend  place  78L05 for better PLL stability

C155		optional, place it if 968VL is  restarting sometimes.
C103,C104,C105  optional, recommend for improvement of pictures quality.
All 10nF capacitor can be replaced with 100nF capacitor, recommend.   10nF was old design value

count without  units = resistor  (example: 10 = 10 ohm )

Config-Resistor with 47k resistor, pleas see attached pictures "config_resistor.jpg".
